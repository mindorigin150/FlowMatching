# MIT 6.S184: Generative AI with Stochastic Differential Equations

This repository contains the lab assignments for MIT 6.S184: Generative AI with Stochastic Differential Equations.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main components:

### 1. Labs with Unit Tests
- `lab_one.ipynb` - Lab 1: Simulating ODEs and SDEs
- `lab_two.ipynb` - Lab 2: (Description TBD)
- `lab_three.ipynb` - Lab 3: A Conditional Generative Model for Images

Each lab notebook includes comprehensive unit tests that I've added to help verify the correctness of implementations. These tests check:
- Mathematical formula correctness
- Shape consistency across different batch sizes
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Statistical properties and convergence
- Integration with other components

### 2. Solutions
My personal solutions to the lab assignments are located in the `solutions/` directory.

## About the Unit Tests

The unit tests have been added to provide immediate feedback on implementation correctness. Each test cell is placed directly below the corresponding function that needs to be implemented, allowing you to:
- Verify your work immediately after completing each section
- Understand the expected behavior through comprehensive test cases
- Catch common mistakes and edge cases early

## Course Information

MIT 6.S184 focuses on generative AI techniques using stochastic differential equations, covering topics such as:
- Numerical methods for ODEs and SDEs
- Flow matching and diffusion models
- Conditional generation and classifier-free guidance
- Modern architectures like U-Net for image generation
